# Pagination

In this guide, we will look at how to work with paginated responses when querying the wunderdocs API. By default, all responses limit results to 25. However, you can go as high as 100 by adding a `limit` parameter to your requests.{{ className: 'lead' }}

When an API response returns a list of objects, no matter the amount, pagination is supported. In paginated responses, objects are nested in a `data` attribute. Also there are two additional attributes: `totalCount` and `filteredCount`. The `totalCount` attribute indicates the total number of objects in the resultset, while the `filteredCount` attribute indicates the number of objects returned in the response. So if you have 100 objects in your resultset and you limit the response to 25, the `totalCount` will be 100 and the `filteredCount` will be 25. You can use the `totalCount` attribute to calculate the number of pages in your resultset. For example, if you have 100 objects and you limit the response to 25, you will have 4 pages.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example using offset pagination

<Row>
  <Col>
In this example we will use the `offset` and `limit` parameters to paginate through a list of conversations. The `offset` parameter is used to indicate the number of objects to skip before returning the response. The `limit` parameter is used to indicate the number of objects to return in the response.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="totalCount" type="integer">
        The total number of objects in the resultset.
      </Property>
      <Property name="filteredCount" type="integer">
        The number of objects returned in the response.
      </Property>
      <Property name="data" type="object">
        The actuall objects returned in the response.
      </Property>
    </Properties>
