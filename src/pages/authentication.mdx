# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the wunderdocs API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Wunderdocs currently offers one way to authenticate which is via API key. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### Authentication with API key

The API key is a unique identifier that you generate using the [wunderdocs dashboard](https://app.wunderdocs.io/settings) under API settings. You must include an API key with every API request. API keys only give access to data, so they can't be used to log in to the wunderdocs dashboard.

## Get your API key

After logging in navigate to the [settings](https://app.wunderdocs.io/settings) page and scroll to the bottom. Click on the "Add new API key" button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the API key to confirm the action. After that, you will see your API key.

By clicking on "Copy Key" you can copy the API key to your clipboard and use it in your requests.

## Add your API key to your request

Once you have your API key, you can add it to your requests by adding it to the `X-API-KEY` header. Here's an example using cURL:


```bash {{ title: 'Example request with API key' }}
    curl -G https://api.wunderdocs.io/v1/templates \
      -H "X-API-KEY: {api-key}"
```

<Note>
Please don't commit your wunderdocs API key to a public git!
